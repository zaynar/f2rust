Standard library for FORTRAN-to-Rust translated programs.

Part of the [f2rust](https://github.com/zaynar/f2rust) project.

This includes some support for FORTRAN's formatted IO, but only the features
needed for implementing the [SPICE Toolkit](https://github.com/zaynar/rsspice).
It is not currently designed to work with any other FORTRAN programs.
