Cut-down version of [ryu](https://crates.io/crates/ryu),
exposing the decimal mantissa/exponent representation.

Inspired by [ryu_floating_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/ryu_floating_decimal),
but adapted from a more recent release of ryu.

Part of the [f2rust](https://github.com/zaynar/f2rust) project.
